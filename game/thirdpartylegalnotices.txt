      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

	OVERVIEW
	========

	This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and
	decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
	method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
	"real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images
	are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not
	exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you
	have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images,
	very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and
	remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a
	low-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment
	with various compression settings.

	This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
	compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
	processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
	For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding
	variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting
	the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.

	We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
	plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
	perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
	The library is intended to be reused in other applications.

	In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
	considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
	for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
	decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
	colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
	library if not required for a particular application.  We have also included
	"jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG
	processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple applications for
	inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.

	The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
	flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
	the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
	REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
	be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
	achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.

	We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
	No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
	documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.


	LEGAL ISSUES
	============

	In plain English:

	1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
	   please let us know!)
	2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
	3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
	   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
	   you've used the IJG code.

	In legalese:

	The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
	with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
	fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
	its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

	This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
	All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

	Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
	software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
	conditions:
	(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
	README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
	unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
	must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
	(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
	documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
	the Independent JPEG Group".
	(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
	full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
	NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

	These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
	not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
	acknowledge us.

	Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
	in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
	it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
	software".

	We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
	commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
	assumed by the product vendor.


	ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
	sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
	ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
	by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
	that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
	ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
	of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
	the foregoing paragraphs do.

	The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
	It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
	The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
	ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
	by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

	It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
	patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
	legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
	support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
	(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
	Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
	So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
	code.

	The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
	To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
	been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
	"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
	resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
	GIF decoders.

	We are required to state that
		"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
		CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
		CompuServe Incorporated."


	REFERENCES
	==========

	We highly recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
	understand the innards of the JPEG software.

	The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
		Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
		Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
	(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
	applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue
	handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is
	available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually
	a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
	omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
	and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
	and it may not be used for commercial purposes.

	A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
	"The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by
	M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
	good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods
	including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C
	code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG
	sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look
	at a full implementation, you've got one here...

	The best full description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still Image Data
	Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published
	by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp.
	The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1
	and draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG
	in existence, and we highly recommend it.

	The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a
	paper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified
	official copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead;
	it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.)
	In the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212)
	642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI
	doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of
	1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7%
	shipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the
	actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1
	is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
	Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
	10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of
	Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
	numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.

	Some extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3,
	a newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.  IJG
	currently does not support any Part 3 extensions.

	The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
	format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
	1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from:
		Literature Department
		C-Cube Microsystems, Inc.
		1778 McCarthy Blvd.
		Milpitas, CA 95035
		phone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314
	A PostScript version of this document is available by FTP at
	ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text
	version at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing
	the figures.

	The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
	ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
	found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
	IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
	Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
	(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or
	from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision
	of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
	Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
	uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available
	from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.


	ARCHIVE LOCATIONS
	=================

	The "official" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet
	address 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found
	there in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived
	as ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.  If you don't have
	direct Internet access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact
	help@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.

	Numerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However, only
	ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.

	You can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible "zip" archive format from
	the SimTel archives (ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or
	on CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12
	"JPEG Tools".  Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net
	release.

	The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of
	general information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is
	not included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to
	Usenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups.
	It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/
	and other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers
	archive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/.
	If you don't have Web or FTP access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
	with body
		send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1
		send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part2


	RELATED SOFTWARE
	================

	Numerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.  (Quite a
	few of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above lists
	some of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to
	obtain them on Internet.

	If you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free
	PBMPLUS software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format image
	files.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of
	other formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest
	version is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous
	sites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.
	Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is;
	you are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.

	A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford,
	is available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program
	is designed for research and experimentation rather than production use;
	it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it
	is easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG,
	which we do not.  (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)


	FILE FORMAT WARS
	================

	Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library.
	The root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a
	concrete file format.  Some vendors "filled in the blanks" on their own,
	creating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none
	of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to
	exchange compressed files.)

	The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format
	has been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has
	become the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or "low end" representation.
	We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF
	Technical Note #2) for "high end" applications that need to record a lot of
	additional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely
	supported, unfortunately.

	The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF.
	SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should
	be able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical
	advantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an
	official standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear
	whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto
	standard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we
	have not decided whether it should become our default output format or not.
	(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)

	Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist.
	We have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed,
	one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help
	force convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't
	use a proprietary file format!


	TO DO
	=====

	The major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality.
	The current method for scaling the quantization tables is known not to be
	very good at low Q values.  We also intend to investigate block boundary
	smoothing, "poor man's variable quantization", and other means of improving
	quality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.

	In future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG
	Part 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file
	format.

	As always, speeding things up is of great interest.

	Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
*                                                                      *

*  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *
*  --------------------------                                          *
*                                                                      *
*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *
*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *
*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *
*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *
*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *
*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
*                                                                      *

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
  License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
  file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

  This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as
  defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

For Cairo
************************************************************************************

Cairo is free software.

Every source file in the implementation[*] of cairo is available to be
redistributed and/or modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public
License (MPL) version 1.1.  Some files are available under more
liberal terms, but we believe that in all cases, each file may be used
under either the LGPL or the MPL.

See the following files in this directory for the precise terms and
conditions of either license:

	COPYING-LGPL-2.1
	COPYING-MPL-1.1

Please see each file in the implementation for copyright and licensing
information, (in the opening comment of each file).

[*] The implementation of cairo is contained entirely within the "src"
directory of the cairo source distribution. There are other components
of the cairo source distribution (such as the "test", "util", and "perf")
that are auxiliary to the library itself. None of the source code in these
directories contributes to a build of the cairo library itself, (libcairo.so
or cairo.dll or similar).

These auxiliary components are also free software, but may be under
different license terms than cairo itself. For example, most of the
test cases in the perf and test directories are made available under
an MIT license to simplify any use of this code for reference purposes
in using cairo itself. Other files might be available under the GNU
General Public License (GPL), for example. Again, please see the COPYING
file under each directory and the opening comment of each file for copyright
and licensing information.
