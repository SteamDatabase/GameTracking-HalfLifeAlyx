This value defines the tolerance of how different the height of the foot can be from one frame to the next and still be considered \"stationary\""

This value defines the tolerance of how high the foot can be from its lowest point in the animation before it is considered to be raised off the ground as part of a step"

This value represents how different the foot locations can be between the start and end of a step before the motion is considered to be walking in place.  "
